# cs50-web-auction

This is the second project in series of 
projects from a web development course I 
took on edX titled, [Web Programming with 
Python and Javascript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/)

This entailed designing an eBay-like e-commerce auction 
site that will allow users to post auction 
listings, place bids on listings, comment 
on those listings, and add listings to a
 “watchlist.”

How to run the project:
You will need:
- Python v3 or later
- Django 3.1
